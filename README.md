# Note-Taker

## Description
- The purpose of this assignment was to modify starter code to amend a full stack application in order to allow it to store and access data input to the user onto an 'Express' server with a json file acting a database. This app should allow a user to type in a note with a title and allow them to save it in order to access it again later.

## Technologies Utilized in Modifying the Starter Code:
-Javascript
-Node
-NPM package
-Express
-Uniqid
-Insomnia (for testing)
-Heroku (for deploying)
-Github (for version control)

## Installation & Use:
In the command line:
-npm i
-npm i express
-npm i uniqid

To start the server:
-node server.js

## Challenges & Thoughts:
I had issues with the application's proper functionality regarding storing notes and whatnot and having the CSS work correctly. I also had trouble properly utilizing Insomnia and at times misunderstood what it was showing, specifically with POST requests and how sending JSON data was to be done within Insomnia and not the mock front end portion. It was cathartic getting the routes correct and finally getting the information stored properly. For some reason the front end is not displaying the stored data? I am unsure why there is an issue pulling back the stored data to display it. The routes and such are transmitting information.
